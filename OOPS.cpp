/*
OOP (Object-oriented programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: 
data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
Object-oriented programming â€“ As the name suggests uses objects in programming. 
Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. 
The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them.
Class->We can say that a Class in C++ is a blue-print representing a group of objects which shares some common properties and behaviours.
Object->An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behaviour. An Object is an instance of a Class. 
When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.
